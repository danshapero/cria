This directory contains the sources for the compiler.

See the `syntactic` subdirectory for source files that handle the syntactic analysis of the input code, e.g. lexer and parser.

See the `semantic` subdirectory for source files that handle the semantic analysis of the parsed source code, e.g. the type checker and the normalizer.
